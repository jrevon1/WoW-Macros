# What is this?

  A macro for World of Warcraft Classic for all-in-one damage and healing, with mouseover and target priority, and downranking using a preferred toggle key.

# What?

  I play a priest in World of Warcraft (WoW) Classic. Due to the nature of WoW's mechanics, there are times when I need to use a healing spell with a lower resource cost, but keeping multiple copies of the same spell would take up way too much space on my interface.

  This macro allows the user to "downrank" their larger-resource-cost spells (effectively freeing up space in their interface by replacing multiple copies of a spell with one spell), as well as allowing them to use an additional and separate spell to deal damage when they don't need to heal.

  It also prioritizes the right spell based on whether your mouse is hovering over a friendly or enemy target, or even yourself.
